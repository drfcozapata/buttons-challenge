<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./public/buttons-final.png)

This is the solution created with Vue.js to the Buttons Challenge of DevChallenge.io.

The Figma model left as a guide was followed strictly and in detail.

We used Vue.js 3 as framework (Script Setup + TypeScript), TailwindCSS and Material Icons. The Vue project was created using Vite and Yarn.

A single component (button) was created and the different buttons indicated by the Figma model were generated using props.

You can see the final result in the Demo.
